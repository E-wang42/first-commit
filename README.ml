According to the standard Big Bang model, the universe was born during a period of inflation that began about 13.8 billion years ago. 
Like a rapidly expanding balloon, it swelled from a size smaller than an electron to nearly its current size within a tiny fraction of a second

Initially, the universe was permeated only by energy. Some of this energy congealed into particles, which assembled into light atoms like hydrogen and helium. 
These atoms clumped first into galaxies, then stars, inside whose fiery furnaces all the other elements were forged

This is the generally agreed-upon picture of our universe's origins as depicted by scientists. It is a powerful model that explains many of the things scientists see when they look up in the sky, 
such as the remarkable smoothness of space-time on large scales and the even distribution of galaxies on opposite sides of the universe.
